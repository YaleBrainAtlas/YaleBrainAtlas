## Description

This repository contains contains all code needed to run [the website for the Yale Brain Atlas](https://yalebrainatlas.github.io/YaleBrainAtlas/). Additionally, this repository stores all data for Yale Brain Atlas and its multimodal neuroimaging data in the `/data` folder.

This repository was introduced as part of our paper "Structural and functional data in an interactive human brain atlas".



# Abstract

Understanding the structure-function relationship in the human brain is essential for revealing how brain organization influences behavior and contributes to disease. Towards this, here we introduce datasets and interactive software which integrate structural and functional neuroimaging data in the Yale Brain Atlas, whose high-resolution anatomical parcellation is well suited for precise localization and generalizable analyses. For structural data, we provide the white matter connectomes of 1065 subjects and cortical thickness profiles of 200 subjects in Yale Brain Atlas space. For functional data, we include resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) correlation connectivity matrices for 34 healthy subjects and task-specific fMRI activation data acquired from two meta-analytic resources – Neurosynth and NeuroQuery – which once translated into Yale Brain Atlas space and modified to include 334 function-specific terms, form Parcelsynth and ParcelQuery, respectively. Lastly, we introduce a website to interactively explore the Yale Brain Atlas and its multimodal data.
